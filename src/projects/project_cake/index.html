            typos)</h6>

        <p class="text-center leading-tight md:text-left md:text-1xl">
            Essentially a rimworld/dwarf-fortress esque cooking sim. where you own a restaurant and you need to keep it
            running for as many years/days or months as possible.
            The game will give you a basic set of ingredients and players can unlock more complex/expensive tasting
            ingredients as time goes own or as they make more money to buy these better ingredients.
        </p>
        <p class="my-1 text-center leading-tight md:text-left md:text-1xl">
            I still don't know if price should be determined by the customers or if price could be the total cost of the
            ingredients and then some added percentage. Customers coming into the restaurant would typically have a
            desired ingredient they want in their dish but it won't be of a particular quality. Players can then make
            any kind of dish for this customer as long as that ingredient or ingredients is included in the dish. I'm
            also thinking that customers can have different moods and it could be possible for this mood to be affected
            by different factors like the weather of the day or maybe they change their order/mind randomly. The end
            game could be that you're competing with other ai restaurants and the restaurants that stay at the bottom 3
            for 3 consecutive days/weeks/months or years will be destroyed/demolished/close (still don't know yet).
            I'm also thinking different ingredients can be prepared anyway e.g a player could choose to fry beef or
            grill it or maybe even put it in the oven as long as the result matches the customers desire etc. That's
            where I've thought of for now.
