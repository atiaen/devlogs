            So I still don't have name for this project but I have an idea and some systems I want to make. Below is the
            list of systems:
        </p>
        <section>
            <ol>
                <li class="px-auto mx-auto">
                    <h6 class="font-bold">Cooking System</h6>
                    <span>
                        Ingredient Management: Players manage and unlock various ingredients, each with different
                        qualities and preparation methods (frying, grilling, baking, etc.). (In progress)
                        Dish Creation: Players combine ingredients to create dishes. The system allows for flexibility
                        in
                        how dishes are made, enabling creative combinations. (In progress)
                        Preparation Methods: Players can choose how to prepare ingredients (e.g., fry, grill, bake),
                        adding another layer of depth to the cooking process.
                    </span>

                </li>
                <li class="px-auto mx-auto">
                    <h6 class="font-bold"> Customer Interaction System
                    </h6>
                    <span>
                        Customer Desires: Each customer has a desired ingredient, and players must incorporate this into
                        their dish. The desire is not quality-specific, allowing for flexibility in satisfying the
                        customer.
                        (In progress)
                        Customer Moods: Customer moods are influenced by various factors (e.g., weather, random events),
                        adding unpredictability to customer behavior.
                        Order Changes: Customers may change their orders or desires, adding a dynamic challenge for
                        players.
                    </span>

                </li>
                <li class="px-auto mx-auto">
                    <h6 class="font-bold"> Economic System
                    </h6>
                    <span>
                        Ingredient Pricing: The cost of ingredients and the potential for unlocking more
                        expensive/complex
                        ones as players progress.
                        Dish Pricing: Pricing of dishes could be determined by either the customers or based on the
                        total
                        cost of ingredients plus a percentage markup.
                        Profit Management: Players must balance costs, pricing, and customer satisfaction to maintain
                        profitability.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li class="px-auto mx-auto">
                    <h6 class="font-bold"> Competition System

                    </h6>
                    <span>
                        AI Restaurants: Competing against AI-controlled restaurants, with the risk of being shut down if
                        ranked low for consecutive periods.
                        Leaderboard Dynamics: A ranking system where the bottom 3 restaurants for a certain period
                        (days/weeks/months/years) face consequences like closure or demolition.
                        Market Influence: Playersâ€™ performance affects their standing in the market, encouraging
                        strategic
                        play.

                    </h6>
                    <span>
                        Weather Effects: Weather conditions can influence customer moods and behavior, adding another
                        layer
                        of unpredictability.
                        Random Events: Unplanned events that can change customer desires or restaurant operations,
                        requiring
                        players to adapt quickly.

            <p>So far I've only managed to do the cooking system (I'll add some images of it later)</p>
            <p>But right now I simply create a list of ingredients as JSON. Load it up into Unity as a resource from the
                resources folder</p>
